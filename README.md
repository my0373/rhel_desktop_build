RHEL Desktop Build
------------
A collection of Ansible roles to allow a user to take a standard RHEL 7 desktop installation and harden it.
We need to ensure a secure build for desktop users.

Scenarios we will cover and cater for are...

* Loss of hardware
* Intrusion detection
* Damage limitation if someone does get access to a user account
* Backups
* Centralised user (using IDM)
